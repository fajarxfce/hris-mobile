# Agent continuation — HRIS Mobile

Updated 29 October 2026 (UTC). The overall HRIS PRD remains in progress. This is
the employee application generated from Compose Fluent Starter, and the proving
ground for reusable foundation changes before they are ported to Starter.

## Start here

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, inspect `git status`, the branch, recent commits and upstream.
   The working branch at this checkpoint is `feat/native-push`.
2. Read [validation](validation.md), [local-first coverage](local-first.md), the
   affected module contract and [template updates](template-updates.md).
3. Read the [Platform handoff](https://github.com/fajarxfce/hris-platform/blob/feat/firebase-auth/docs/agent-handoff.md)
   and [remaining PRD delivery](https://github.com/fajarxfce/hris-platform/blob/feat/firebase-auth/docs/completion.md#remaining-delivery-sequence).
   Backend and dashboard work is on Platform `feat/firebase-auth`, most recently
   native transfer fixture `f23b73ba` with global audit/schema 99 `adfb7b32`; Starter work is on `fix/push-token-lifecycle`.

The three local checkouts are siblings under `/home/fajar/hris`. A fresh clone
must be able to continue from tracked evidence; local `.work` logs, screenshots
and `/home/fajar/hris/PRD-PROGRESS.md` are supplementary. The user authorized ongoing
implementation and a push after every atomic commit. This does not authorize a
release. Preserve unrelated edits and keep implementation, tests and docs together.

## Last accepted increments

- Partial-download recovery now passes actual API/PostgreSQL/worker/Garage/Android:
  one retained MiB and transfer count 1 through offline process restart, summary
  no-op HTTP (31 → 31), explicit resume from byte 1,048,576, native save matching
  3,145,841 bytes/SHA-256 and six empty summary rows afterward. The server observed
  49 requests and zero company mutations. Fixture 9.7m/10.2m with setup; unchanged
  loopback APK reused. All owned services, control files, forwarding and public
  copy were removed; emulator app data retained. See
  [executed evidence](validation.md#partial-download-recovery-on-android) and
  [Platform fixture](https://github.com/fajarxfce/hris-platform/blob/feat/firebase-auth/docs/native-download-acceptance.md).

- `c650e0d7` adds an actual unconfirmed Inbox command: server commit
  followed by response loss, Pending actions count 1 through offline cold start,
  local summary reload with no HTTP (30 → 30), exact-operation Retry and zero
  pending afterward. The independent server observed two identical read commands,
  version 1 and no acknowledgment across 42 requests. Fixture 6.0m/6.4m with setup;
  APK assembly 45 seconds. All owned resources were removed and the emulator
  stopped without wiping data. See [executed evidence](validation.md#inbox-command-response-loss-on-android)
  and [Platform's tracked procedure](https://github.com/fajarxfce/hris-platform/blob/feat/firebase-auth/docs/native-acceptance.md).
- `60456c48`: real Android 35/API/PostgreSQL/worker URL and Inbox archival
  acceptance. Cold-login/company gating, repeated/resumed navigation, scope/query
  rejection and offline restoration passed. Independent server reads proved no
  implicit read/acknowledgement or company writes. Archival stayed enforced after
  offline restart. See [exact URL evidence](deep-links.md#android-url-acceptance).
- `1c1f9104`: actual Android/API Pending actions acceptance for pristine and edited
  Leave drafts, offline process restart, local summary refresh, reconnect and
  explicit deletion. Other command/transfer states need their own native evidence.
- `9a557dcc` records cross-platform Firebase CI. Provider implementation `d191c61d`
  passed 1,837 desktop/UI tests, 119 related Chromium cases and Android assembly.
  Actual Firebase email/password completed HRIS exchange, MFA, company selection
  and logout; the temporary provider account was removed. Google chooser/Back
  passed, but actual Google token exchange did not run.

Reusable Firebase adapters are already ported to Starter `9a13791` and documented
at `a16325e`. Notification resource paths, token retirement and incoming-link
ownership were also ported; consult the file/commit ledger in template updates
before repeating a port. The latest native acceptance commits change only docs.
Platform worker observations/global audit are HRIS administration work, and the
native transfer fixture changes no application implementation; no Starter port is due.

## Next work and actual external inputs

Reconcile each remaining acceptance requirement with the code and retained tests
before creating another feature. Native Pending actions still needs acceptance
for upload/review and other feature outcomes beyond the accepted Leave working-copy,
unconfirmed Inbox-command and partial-download cases. Existing per-feature delivery and lifecycle tests are not evidence for every
summary state on a device. Continue useful independent cases while provider input
is unavailable.

Firebase project `cmp-fajar` has Email/password and Google enabled. Android configs
exist locally in ignored `apps/android/google-services.json`; do not commit provider
credentials. The known remaining external work includes actual Google ID-token
acceptance, FCM service-account configuration and real registration/scoped hint
delivery, iOS Firebase/APNs/device setup, verified HTTPS associations and physical
location/device acceptance. Recheck local availability before asking for inputs
already supplied. Public Android config is not an FCM server credential.

## Validation and device ownership

Use JDK 21 and `ANDROID_HOME=/home/fajar/Android/Sdk`. On headless Linux, root
checks use `xvfb-run -a ./gradlew --no-daemon :check`; Android development assembly
is `:apps:android:assembleDevDebug`. Select related Chromium tasks from the owning
module and inspect [development](development.md) and [distribution](distribution.md).
Do not infer device/provider acceptance from compilation or fixture responses.

Use AVD `hris-mobile-dev`, serial `emulator-5560`; never wipe its retained data.
The last acceptance used a build-specific loopback API override. Preserve the
normal environment configuration and inspect any fixture before starting another.
The accepted fixtures were stopped and private connection files removed. Phone
delivery is install-only under `AGENTS.md`: notify before installation, select its
serial explicitly and do not launch or operate its UI while it is in use.

Update this handoff and validation after each accepted increment. Include the
exact remaining work, known failed attempts and corrected causes, resource cleanup
and whether a reusable change still needs its validated Starter port.
