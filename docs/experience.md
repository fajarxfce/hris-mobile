# Mobile experience

Use Fluent visual language with a mobile-first layout. Keep navigation, wording,
and actions direct. Company identity and the current employee scope must remain
clear without turning the phone screen into a compressed administrative portal.

- Use compact headers, readable lists, clear grouping, generous touch targets,
  and a small set of stable bottom-navigation destinations. Selected items use
  color and emphasis rather than a separate card.
- Preserve each tab's position, keep keyboard and system insets correct, and
  prevent a response from moving controls while the user is interacting.
- Use brief page transitions, selection changes, and inline feedback. Motion
  should explain a change of context or state, usually within 120–180 ms. Avoid
  decorative loops, large bounces, or staggered animation on every list row.
- Honor reduced motion and system animation settings. Completion, errors, and
  pending synchronization must remain understandable without animation.
- Replace account/company content immediately when its authorization scope changes;
  do not retain private outgoing content for a transition.
- Keep existing content during refresh. Reserve initial loading placeholders
  for missing content, and show an explicit recoverable error if loading fails.
- A queued offline action is visibly pending, not confirmed. Retain the command
  and its outcome in state/storage independently of a transient success effect.
- Lifecycle-aware route collectors own effects. Animations, timers, and input
  listeners must stop with their owners; no network or database work belongs in
  composition or animation callbacks.

Check light/dark contrast, text scaling, screen-reader labels, focus, keyboard,
touch targets, tab state, and interrupted transitions. Build/test results do not
establish frame-time or memory performance; record actual device observations
and measured workloads separately.
